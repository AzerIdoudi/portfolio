        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated software engineering student pursuing my Engineering degree at Tek-Up University, having already earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering. Over the past two years, I have gained hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying web and mobile applications. My projects include building an e-commerce platform with an admin dashboard, a carpooling mobile application to improve transportation efficiency, and a comprehensive task and project management system for team collaboration.

Alongside development, I am skilled in the deployment process, which involves preparing applications for production by optimizing and building them, securely transferring the files to remote servers, configuring server environments to efficiently host the applications, and setting up monitoring to ensure ongoing reliability and performance. This experience has enabled me to deliver scalable, user-focused software solutions that perform well in real-world environments.
