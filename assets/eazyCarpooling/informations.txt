a simple carpooling mobile application that I personally designed and developed using Flutter for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. This app aims to simplify ride-sharing and enhance commuting experiences. Here’s how it works:
Sign Up: Create an account and choose your role (driver or passenger). 
•For Drivers:
-Add your cars and manage them (must have at least one car).
-Handle trip requests.
-Keep track of your location.
-Access your account settings.
•For Passengers:
-Know your position at all times.
-Explore the list of available drivers and their cars.
-Request a ride.
-Delete unwanted trips.
-Manage your account.
