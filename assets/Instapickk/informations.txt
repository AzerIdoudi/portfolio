Excited to share Instapickk, a project management web application I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
Instapickk is designed to help individuals and teams plan, track, and collaborate on projects with a clean and intuitive interface. I focused on building a practical and scalable solution that supports real-world workflows.
Key Features:
User authentication with JWT
Role-based access for project members
Project and task management with deadlines and statuses
Calendar view for timeline organization
Task-level comments and team collaboration tools
In-app notifications
Activity log for full project visibility
The frontend is fully responsive across devices.
(Some of the text content visible to users, such as UI descriptions and placeholder content, was generated with the help of AI to speed up writing and save time during development.)
