 I've built and deployed a complete management solution for GSN at greatsportnutrition.com.tn 
This full-stack project combines a powerful React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend and MongoDB database.
Key Features:
💻 Responsive admin dashboard for complete business management
🏋️‍♀️ Custom athlete partnership system with commission tracking and promo codes
🛍️ Product catalog with dynamic filtering and search capabilities
📊 Comprehensive order processing and inventory management
🖼️ Customizable landing page with dynamic content management
📱 Fully responsive design for all devices
Technical Highlights:
🔧 Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
🚀 Deployed on DigitalOcean droplet with Nginx as reverse proxy
🔒 Implemented HTTPS with Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
🌐 Custom domain configuration with DNS A records pointing to the droplet IP
📦 RESTful API architecture with JWT authentication
⚡ PM2 process manager for Node.js application reliability
Deployment Process:
The deployment involved configuring a DigitalOcean Ubuntu droplet, setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle multiple services, obtaining and auto-renewing SSL certificates through "Let's Encrypt", and configuring the DNS records for greatsportnutrition.com.tn to point to our server.
This project showcases my ability to deliver end-to-end solutions that combine business requirements with technical implementation - from development all the way through production deployment and security hardening.
Special thanks to the GSN Supplements team for their collaboration throughout this journey!
